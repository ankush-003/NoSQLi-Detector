# NoSQLi-Detector
DistilBERT-based NoSQL Injection Payload Detection Model 
- This repo contains a fine-tuned DistilBERT model that can be used to detect NoSQL injection payloads. The model was trained on a dataset of known NoSQL injection payloads, and it can be used to classify new payloads as either malicious or benign.

- The model is implemented in Python, and it can be used with any NoSQL database. The repo also includes a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to use the model.
